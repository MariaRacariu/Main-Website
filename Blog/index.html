                <p>Everyone is depressed and if you are not then you are the odd one out. Teenagers are more depressed the asylum patient in the 1970s. Does this prove that all our parents where sick in the head or is this a side affect of them being born directly after the second WW2 to parents who mostly likely served or where affected by it.

                seam to get it. Does this prove that the school system failed them and does that mean that the school system will fail the future generations.
